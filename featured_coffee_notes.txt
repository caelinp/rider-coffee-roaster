The first harvest of Geisha from our friends at La Haciendita, this luxurious coffee is pure joy in every cup. Its distinct Jasmine aroma, mild acidity, and notes of peach, orchid, and honeycomb, all make for an alluring experience cup after cup. What truly sets this coffee apart is its velvety smooth body. It's comforting and lavish, and more than a little bit addictive.
